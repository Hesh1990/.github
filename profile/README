## The \#1 provider of NFT domains

[Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) are NFT domains that let you create and own your digital identity and will help shape the future of Web3.

[The Unstoppable Name Service (UNS)](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/uns) is built on Ethereum and utilizes Polygon as a Layer 2 scaling solution. This allows us to provide NFT domains directly to individuals and businesses for a one-time purchase with no renewal fees, minting fees, or gas fees.

An Unstoppable NFT domain acts as a cryptocurrency address, login, universal username, and decentralized website URL.
